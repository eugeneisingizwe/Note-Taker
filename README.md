# Note-Taker

## Description
- In this project I am modifying a starter code to create an application called Note Taker that can be used to write and save notes. This application is using Express.js back end and will save and retrieve note date from a JSON file. This application will be also be deployed to Heroku. 

- This project was built because I as a user I want to be able to take notes, save the notes, and delete the notes when I no longer need them. 

- The note app keeps your notes neat and orginized thus it elleviate that problem. 

- In this project I was able to demostrate concepts learned in class such as API and HTML routes, query params, post requests, body parsing, data parsistence, and modular routing.
